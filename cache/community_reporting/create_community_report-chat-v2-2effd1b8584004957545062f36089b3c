It is not tied to a geographical location but is cultivated in various regions worldwide, including Nigeria, Ghana, parts of the United States, and Brazil, thriving under tropical climatic conditions. Tomatoes prefer loamy soil, although they can grow in different soil types; however, clay soil's water retention can be detrimental, leading to root rot. The optimal conditions for tomato cultivation include altitudes up to 2,000 meters above sea level, annual rainfall over 600 mm, and temperatures ranging from 20 \u2013 25\u00b0C during the day to 15 \u2013 17\u00b0C at night. Well-drained sandy loam or clay loam soils with a pH range of 6.0 \u2013 7.5 are ideal for tomato farming, which involves specific land preparation techniques, especially in different zones of Nigeria.\n\nTomato is a warm-season crop sensitive to hard freezes, requiring a long growing season for profitable cultivation. It undergoes various stages of maturity for harvest, depending on the use purpose and market distance, and is often grown for processing. The crop is a heavy feeder, requiring high levels of nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, and responds well to organic fertilizers. Specific agricultural practices, including direct seeding, transplanting, staking, training, pruning, regular irrigation, weeding, disease management, and fertilization, are essential for its growth and productivity. These practices help in improving yield, which can reach up to 30 tons per acre, and disease resistance.\n\nTomato plants are susceptible to attacks by various pests and diseases, with the root-knot nematode being the most prevalent nematode affecting the plant's health. Major diseases and physiological disorders also impact the quality and quantity of tomato crops, notably in Kenya.
