This disease is caused by a fungus that is both seed- and soil-borne, thriving in light, sandy soils. It is most active at temperatures between 25 and 32\u00b0C. Fusarium Wilt is characterized by the yellowing and dying of lower leaves, along with a reddish-brown discoloration in stems and petioles, indicating its detrimental impact on the plant's vascular system. The disease leads to the wilting and eventual death of the plant, posing a significant threat to tomato fields. Its spread can be exacerbated by weeding when the soil is wet. Management practices and control measures are crucial for mitigating the impact of Fusarium Wilt, although specific details on these practices were not provided in the text.\",4\n181,\"\"\"AMARANTHUS\"\"\",\"Amaranthus, a genus of plants, is known for its ability to host the Fusarium Wilt fungus, which contributes to the persistence of the disease in soil. This characteristic highlights the plant's role in the spread and maintenance of the fungus within affected environments. Additionally, while Amaranthus is sometimes mentioned in discussions about species affected by certain soil conditions, it's important to clarify that Amaranthus is not a single species but rather a genus. This distinction is crucial for understanding the broader implications of how these plants interact with their environment and the diseases that affect them.\",1\n182,\"\"\"DIGITARIA\"\"\",\"Digitaria, a genus of grasses, is known to host the Fusarium Wilt fungus, contributing to the persistence of the disease in soil. Despite being listed among species affected by soil conditions, it is important to note that Digitaria is actually misclassified in this context, as it is not a single species but rather a genus comprising multiple species of grasses. This genus plays a significant role in agricultural and ecological settings due to its interaction with soil pathogens like the Fusarium Wilt fungus.\",1\n183,\"\"\"MALVA\"\"\",\"Malva, a genus of plants, is recognized for its susceptibility to hosting the Fusarium Wilt fungus, which contributes to the persistence of the disease in soil. This species of weed is notably affected by soil conditions, highlighting the importance of environmental factors in its growth and health.
