A well-drained, fairly light fertile loam with a fair moisture holding capacity is ideal for growing a good crop of Tomato. Good texture of the soil is of primary importance, although poor or medium quality land produces good early crop if managed properly. Tomato crop prefers a soil reaction ranging from pH 6.0 to 7.0. In acidic soils, liming is bene\uf001cial for pH balance.\nClimate\nTomato, being a warm season Crop requires a long season to produce a pro\uf001table Crop. It is tender and will not withstand a hard freeze. In regions having less than 3\u00bd months frost-free period, Tomato is not likely to be pro\uf001table. High humidity with high temperature favors the development of foliage diseases. On the other hand, hot drying winds often result in the dropping of the blossoms. The Tomato plant produces large yields under irrigation in semiarid and arid regions.\nSeed Treatment\nSeed treatment with hydrogen peroxide (0.2 to 0.6 percent) for 2 to 4 days at 21\u00b0C gives an early emergent of seedlings by 7 to 8 days and also yields 22.8% higher yield. Heat treatment at 60\u00b0C for 6 hours also proves effective in increasing the yield by\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
