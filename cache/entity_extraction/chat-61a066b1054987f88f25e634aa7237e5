Manure improves the water and nutrients retention rates of soil. I have seen a tomato farmer who increased his yield by 70% because he used chicken manure. \nAt the pre-planting stage in tomato farming, a fertilizer with a higher phosphorus content should be used. Phosphorus helps in building the roots of plants. Plants with wellformed and bigger roots extract more water and nutrients from the soil; this also leads to enhanced yield. Fertilisers like single super phosphate (ssp), Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), potassium sulfate, dolomite, calmag fertilizer and ammonium nitrate can be applied. Simple NPK fertilisers can also be applied. Fertiliser application called base dressing is very important at the pre-planting stage. \nAt the vegetative stage when the tomato plants are having a lot of leaves, fertilisers with a high nitrogen value should be used. Examples of high nitrogenous fertilisers are urea, NPK 20:10:10 and nitrate fertilisers. These fertilizes make the leaves bigger. Big leaves enable the plant to make use of sunlight well and improve photosynthesis. Calcium fertilizer like calcium nitrate should also be used at the vegetative stage. Calcium is known to help plants in preventing diseases. It also improves flowering and fruiting. When the tomato plants are flowering and fruiting, fertilisers with high potassium and calcium contents should be used.
