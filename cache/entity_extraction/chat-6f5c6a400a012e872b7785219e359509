Site Selection \nTomato prefers farmland or soil that is fertile. The site to be used for the growing of tomato should have a sandy loamy soil rich in organic matters. \nThe site should also have good roads for easy evacuation of produce after harvest. Tomatoes can get bad if they are not quickly evacuated to a place where they can be used or preserved. \nTomato can grow under tropical climatic conditions. It can grow in temperature of 10 Celsius to 30 Celsius. When temperature exceeds 35 Celsius, there will be flower abortion and a decline in the physiological processes in the tomato plant. Tomato can do well in Rain Forest, Guinea Savannah, Sudan Savannah, Sahel Savannah, Plateau Area and Mangrove Regions of Nigeria.
