Tomato plants like loamy soil, clay soil can retain a lot of water that can cause root rot. \nIn the savannah zones of Nigeria (most Northern states), it is somewhat easy to do land preparation for tomato farming because the land is populated by mostly grasses and short weeds. A tractor can easily plough and harrow the land and make it ready for planting. \nIn the rain forest and other forest zones of Nigeria, the vegetation is thick with trees forming canopies. To do land preparation in these zones, the farmer may need to hire a bulldozer. Please note if a bulldozer is used, the top soil must not be removed. The cost of land preparation in the forest zones in Nigeria is high. \nPlough of the soil is done immediately after the trees and other vegetation have been removed from the farmland. Harrowing follows ploughing. Riding is also advised to be done. Ridging improves the soil and improves water retention. A tractor can do plough, harrowing and ridging. \nThe use of manure especially chicken manure is advisable after ridging. Some people apply manure and re-plough their farmland so that the manure can be well mixed with the soil. \n \n6. Variety of Tomato to Plant (Tomato Seeds) \nThere are different types of tomato seeds. Tomato seeds can be categorized under hybrid seeds\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
