Tomato Harvest \nIn tomato farming, harvesting typically commences 55-70 days after transplanting depending on the variety of tomato planted. Some varieties of tomatoes have thick fruits; these thick fruits last longer than the soft skin tomato varieties. It is advised that a farmer should have a way of preserving his tomato fruits after harvest. \nTomatoes are usually harvested when they are red or yellow turning into red. Some tomato farmers harvest their tomatoes when green, I do not advise this as it may be difficult to turn the colour from green to red. People will not buy green tomatoes.. For those who have the financial capability, you can harvest your tomato fruits and process them into paste and puree on farm. Tomatoes can also be harvested, sun dried and milled into powder. \n15. Post-Harvest and Marketing \nPost-harvest activities in tomato farming include sorting, packaging and storage of the harvested tomato fruits. \nTomato can be sold as fresh tomatoes or processed into other products. Fresh tomatoes are usually sold in the open markets and the more organized markets like hotels and supermarkets in Nigeria. \nGrowth Stages of Tomato Plants \nTomato plants have a similar\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
