It can grow in temperature of 10 Celsius to 30 Celsius. When temperature exceeds 35 Celsius, there will be flower abortion and a decline in the physiological processes in the tomato plant. Tomato can do well in Rain Forest, Guinea Savannah, Sudan Savannah, Sahel Savannah, Plateau Area and Mangrove Regions of Nigeria. It should be noted that tomato do not like areas with a high humidity level. \n2. Climatic conditions for tomato farming \nTomato plants grow well in tropical conditions. Tomato plants will not do well in temperate environment. It is not uncommon to see that tomato plants thrive in warm countries like Nigeria, Ghana, parts of the United States and Brazil etc. The optimum growing temperature for tomatoes is 20 \u2013 28 Celsius, though some varieties of tomatoes that are heat tolerant like Platinum F1 can still do well in very hot temperature. The flowers of tomato plants abort when it is too hot, when it is also too cold, the fruits will not set. \nIn areas where the climatic conditions are not favourable for the cultivation of tomatoes, climate controlled greenhouses can be used. Greenhouses can be used to mimic the conditions suitable for tomato farming. \n \n3. Finance Requirement \nTo grow tomato, you need to compute and analyze the expected cost, expected revenue and expected profit. A tomato farming business plan has to be written\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
