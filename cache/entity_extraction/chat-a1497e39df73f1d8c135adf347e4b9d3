Nematicides like vellum and wormforce can be used to prevent or control these types of pests as they can inflict damages on tomato plants. \nTo control pests, chemical pesticides, organic pesticides and biopesticides can be used. Chemical pesticides include insecticides, acaricides, nematicides and fungicides manufactured with chemicals. These chemical pesticides can be effective in the prevention and control of pests in tomato farming in Nigeria. \nBiopesticides use biological like beneficial microbes to overwhelm or prevent and control pests in farming. There are some beneficial bacteria and fungicides that can be used in tomato farming for pest control and prevention. \nNeem oil is an organic fungicide and insecticide that can be used for the prevention and control of pests in farming. A suitable surfactant should be used to mix neem oil in water before use on plants. \n \n13. Disease Control in Tomato Farming \nFrom what I have observed over a period of 10 years in tomato farming in Nigeria, mites attack, bacteria wilt, mosaic viral infection and blight diseases are the commonest diseases of tomato plants. The first guard against diseases in tomato farming is to buy treated seeds from credible suppliers.
