They can harbor pests and diseases which can spread to the tomato plants. Weeds can also reduce tomato yield by as much as 98% as weeds share water and nutrients with the main crop. \nLike peppers and some other crops, pruning of the stems and leaves of tomato plants can make the plant concentrate all efforts and energy on the fruits, pruning in tomato farming leads to higher yield. Pruning should be done only by experienced tomato farmers. \n12. Pest Control in Tomato Farming \nTomato plants and fruits attract a lot of pests, if these pests are not prevented or controlled, a tomato farmer may harvest little or no fruits. Pests and diseases are some of the challenges of tomato farming in Nigerian. \nThe pests that attack tomato plants in Nigeria include flies, white flies, thrips, insects, aphids, pod borers, worms and grubs. \nFor example, cut worms are common in chicken manure, if manure is not treated before application in tomato farming, cut worms can wreck a lot of damages on the tomato plants. \nSome pests like nematodes and root grubs are common in soils in Nigeria. Nematicides like vellum and wormforce can be used to prevent or control these types of pests as they can inflict damages on tomato plants. \nTo control pests, chemical pesticides, organic pesticides and biopesticides can be used.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
