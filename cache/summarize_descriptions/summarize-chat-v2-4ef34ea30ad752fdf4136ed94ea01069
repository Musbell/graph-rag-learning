{"result": "Blossom-end Rot is a physiological disorder primarily affecting tomatoes, though it can occur in other plants as well. This condition is caused by a calcium nitrogen imbalance in the soil, which is often exacerbated by low soil moisture. The disorder manifests as rot at the blossom-end of the fruit, significantly impacting the quality and quantity of the produce. As a physiological condition, Blossom-end Rot highlights the importance of maintaining balanced soil nutrients and adequate moisture levels to prevent its occurrence and ensure healthy plant growth.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
