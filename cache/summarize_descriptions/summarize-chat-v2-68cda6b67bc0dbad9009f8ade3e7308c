This disease is transmitted in several ways, including from tobacco leaves, infected seeds, and plant debris. TMV is characterized by a range of symptoms, including the mottling of leaves, internal browning of fruits, and a darkened, water-soaked appearance of the plant's pith. To control the spread of Tomato Mosaic Virus, specific measures are recommended, such as using disease-free seeds and removing crop debris to prevent transmission.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
