{"result": "Blossom-end Rot is a physiological disorder affecting tomatoes, characterized by a dark brown and sunken surface at the blossom-end of the fruit. This condition is caused by an imbalance between nitrogen, calcium, and soil moisture, leading to a disruption in the fruit's development. Although sometimes referred to as a disease, it is more accurately described as a physiological condition resulting from nutrient imbalances in the soil. The primary cause of Blossom-end Rot is the calcium nitrogen imbalance, which hinders the proper growth and health of the tomato fruits.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
