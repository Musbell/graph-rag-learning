A Sample of a Tomato P lanting Calendar

2.1 Crop Planting Calendar
(GHCP&PHHT20: Q2)
•	A tool used by farmers to plan for production to ensure that marketing coincides with the period of the year when the market price of a produce is highest
Procedure:
Determine from the market survey results (2.1) when 
there is peak demand for Tomato
Work backwards from the month when there is peak demand to prepare a monthly farm activities preceding the peak period
Use the monthly activities preceding the peak demand as a procurement plan for farm inputs and a guide for farm operations
Notes:
•	To meet the peak demand 
period of the market, there may be need for supplemental irrigation
A Sample of a Tomato Planting Calendar:
Targeting a peak market demand beginning just after January

2.2 Composting

Manure preparation through composting
11/38
2.2 Composting
	
2.2 Composting (GHCP&PHHT20: Q4) 
During compost making, the organic matter need to be covered to prevent leaching and volatilization of nutrients
Tomato is a heavy feeder and does well in soils with high organic content (manure)
Based on the results of the soil analysis, prepare adequate compost for application; the recommended rate of application ranges from 5 – 8 tons/acre

Manure preparation through composting

3.1 Basal Application

Manure incorporation as a basal application
12/38
3.1 Basal Application
	
3.1 Basal Application (GHCP&PHHT20: Q8)
The manure/compost should be broadcasted (5 – 8 tons/acre) then worked into the soil (incorporated) preferably using a hoe 
Manure/compost should be applied 1 – 2 weeks before transplanting the Tomato and incorporated into the soil

3.2 Raising Seedlings

Tomato nursery
3.2 Raising Seedlings
	
3.2 Raising Seedlings (GHCP&PHHT20: Q9)
Tomato can be established through the nursery or directly seeded
Normally, it is raised in nursery before transplanting
The seed rate is about 40 – 75 g/acre
Seed trays can also be used to raise seedlings
Nursery Site Selection:
The nursery should be sited in a plot that has not been planted with a member of Solanaceae family for the last 3 years
Choose the site with good drainage
Nursery Establishment: 
Prepare a seedbed of 1 m width and of a convenient length
Make drills on the seedbed at a spacing of 10 – 20 cm apart
Thinly sow the seeds in the drills and cover lightly with soil
Management of Nursery: 
Water the nursery regularly
Harden the seedlings 1 – 2 weeks before transplanting by reducing the frequency of watering and gradually exposing the seedlings to direct sunlight
Insects such as whiteflies can transmit viruses to young tomato plants hence should be controlled using pesticides e.g. Amitraz (Mitac
20EC®), Buprofezin (Applaud 40%SC®), Azadirachtin (Nimbecidine®), Imidacloprid (Confidor 70 WG®)
These insects can be blocked from reaching the seedlings by use of an insect proof net (agricultural type)
Recently transplanted Tomato seedlings
14/38
3.5 Transplanting
3.5.1 Appropriate Time
Seedlings are transplanted 30 – 45 days after seed sowing
It is recommended that transplanting should be done either early in the morning or late in the evening
3.5.2 Recommended Spacing 
(GHCP&PHHT20: Q10)
Spacing: range from 75 – 100 cm (between rows) by 40 – 60 cm (between seedlings) depending on the variety
Plant Population per Acre: range from 6,666 to 13,333
Appropriate spacing produces short, stocky plants with good root system
3.5.3 Fertilizer Application Rates 
(GHCP&PHHT20: Q11)
Apply 2 – 3 handfuls of manure per planting hole (8 tons/acre) 
Apply 2 bottle tops (10 g) of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) per planting hole (80 kg/acre
Apply Muriate of Potash (MOP) to enhance 
availability of potassium 
3.3 Transplanting
Recently transplanted Tomato seedling
Furrow Irrigation in a Tomato field
3.4 Water Requirement (GHCP&PHHT20: Q12) •	Tomato is sensitive to water deficit: 
Immediately after transplanting
During flowering and fruit development
Plants should be provided with adequate water
Tomato plants are sensitive to water logging and flooded fields should be drained within 1 – 3 days
Irrigation Methods:
Furrow and drip irrigation are the most effective methods
Furrow irrigation minimizes spread of fungal diseases, such as “Early Blight”
Drip irrigation on the other hand is efficient on water utilization
Overhead irrigation encourages spread of diseases such as “Early Blight”
3.5 Managing of Weeds

	
3.5 Managing of Weeds (GHCP&PHHT20: Q13)
Avoid bruising the roots during weeding
This can be done through use of appropriate weeding tools 
Generally, keep the field weed free as much as possible to avoid competition for nutrients, sunlight and moisture
Weeding Tomato field when the soil is wet can increase the spread of some bacterial (Bacterial Wilt) and fungal (Fusarium Wilt) diseases

Tomato under good weed management
3.6 Top-dressing

Top-dressing using the placement method
	
3.6 Top-dressing (GHCP&PHHT20: Q14)
Tomato crop should be fertilized with organic and inorganic chemical fertilizers to produce high yields
Top-dressing fertilizer such as CAN should be applied in 2 splits at 40 kg & 80 kg/acre at 4 and 8 weeks after transplanting
Application method: circular band around the stem
Inadequate top-dressing can result into physiological disorders:
Hollow cavities and poor taste in fruits due to potassium deficiency
Blossom-end rot due to an imbalance between Nitrogen, Calcium and soil moisture

3.7 Crop Management 
3.7.1 Training and Staking 
Indeterminate varieties need staking/training to facilitate pruning, harvesting and other cultural practices
Determinate varieties may be staked in wet season or mulched to prevent fruit contact with the soil
Staking materials: wooden stakes, bamboo or any sturdy material
Strings, plastic strips or other material can be used to train the plant to the stake

Well staked Tomato field
3.7.2 Pruning
Training of Tomato plants in the field A side shoot has been pinched	
This practice is necessary for the indeterminate varieties
It involves removal of side shoots, extra flowers, fruits and diseased leaves
Leads to early maturity of fruits and encourages fruits to increase in size and uniformity
Sterilize pruning blades by use of chlorine bleach and water at a ratio of 1:1. Use of unsterilized blades, and smoking can lead to spread of diseases e.g. TMV, Bacterial Wilt

3.8.1 Major Pests
Pest damage causes a reduction 
in quality and quantity of produce
The following are the major pests of Tomato in Kenya:
African Bollworm
Red Spider Mites
Tobacco Whitefly
Root-knot Nematode
Thrips
Tuta absoluta
3.8.1.A: African Bollworm
Symptom of fruit damaged by “African 
3.8.1.A: African Bollworm Identification:
Adult moth is dull yellow to brown
The female moth lays tiny round & brownish eggs near or on 
flowers or small fruits
Larvae have alternating light and dark colored stripes on either side of the body
The pupa is shiny brown
Damages:
Caterpillars feed on flowers and green fruits causing flower abortion and sunken necrotic spots, respectively
Feeding holes made by the caterpillar serve as entry point for bacteria and fungi which may lead to rotting of fruits
Control:
Tilling & ploughing of old tomato field exposes pupa to desiccation and natural enemies
Planting of trap crops (Cucumber, Maize & Africam Marigold) which attract the pest before it attacks tomatoes (Need to synchronize planting of both maize and tomatoes so that they flower at same time)
Use of selective pesticides, such as microbial control agents:
Helocoverpa armigera SNPV Virus (Helitec SC®)
Indoxacarb (Avaunt 150SL®)
Etofenprox 30%(TREBON 30 EC®)
Symptom of fruit damaged by “African Bollworm”
Underside of Tomato leaf infested with 
“Red Spider Mites”
3.8.1.B: Red Spider Mites Identification:
Adult red spider mites are oval in shape, appear reddish or greenish with eight (8) legs
Eggs are very tiny, spherical and whitish; and are laid singly on underside of leaves
Red spider mites spin silk threads which anchor the pest and their eggs to the plant
Damages:
Infested leaves show white to yellow speckling, later turn pale or bronzed
High population causes serious drying and dropping of leaves (defoliation) which leads to smaller and lighter fruits
Control:
Use of pesticides (miticides) including: 
Spiromesifen (Oberon SC 240®)
Hexythiazox (Arsur 100 EC®)
Abamectin (Avirmec 1.8EC®, Almectin 1.8%EC®, Agrimec 18EC®)
Amitraz (Mitac 20EC®)
Amblyseius californicus (Amblytech®-predatory mite)
Spider mites rapidly develop resistance to pesticides, especially when they are used continuously for several seasons
To avoid development of resistance, farmers need to:
Use miticides with different modes of action and chemical composition/active ingredients- a.i
Avoid routine spraying
Use the recommended dosage

“Red Spider Mites”
3.8.1.C: Tobacco Whitefly

“Tobacco Whitefly” on the Tomato leaf
3.8.1.C: Tobacco Whitefly
3.8.1.C: Tobacco Whitefly Identification:
Adult whitefly resembles small white moth – like insect which cluster on the underside of upper leaves from which they suck sap
Eggs are laid in arc or circle on the underside of young leaves
When eggs hatch they produce greenish white nymphs which resemble scales
Damages:
Suck plant sap and remove nutrients which cause yellowing of infested leaves
The larvae secrete honey dew which supports growth of black sooty mould
Transmit viral diseases, especially Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)
Control:
Keep tomato fields weed-free
Use of yellow sticky traps to monitor their population levels
Cover tomato seedling nurseries with nylon nets or insect proof nets to protect seedlings from Whitefly infestations
Use of insecticides, such as (morning & ring spray)
Amitraz (Mitac 20EC®)
Buprofezin (Applaud 40%SC®)
Azadirachtin (Nimbecidine®)
Imidacloprid (Confidor 70 WG®)

3.8.1.E: Thrips
Symptoms of Thrips Damage on Tomato (Left) and TOSPO Virus Symptom (Right)
3.8.1.E: Thrips
3.8.1.E: Thrips Identification:
Adult thrips are small (0.5 – 2.0 mm), slender and winged
Wings are long, narrow and fringed with long hairs
Nymphs are white or yellow
Both adult and nymphs feed on lower leaf surface, buds, flowers and fruits
It transmits the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus/ Tospovirus (“Kijeshi”)
Damages:
Attack on leaves causes speckling & small necrotic patches
Heavy infestation causes premature wilting, delay in leaf development & distortion of young shoots •	Attack on buds and flowers leads to abortion
Control:
Ploughing and harrowing before transplanting to kill pupae in the soil
Use of insecticides, such as
Lambda-Cyhalothrin (Karate 2.5 WG®)
Abamectin + Acetamiprid (Amazing Top 
100WDG®)
Thrips are difficult to control with insecticides because their habits partially offer protection from insecticides (eggs are laid in plant tissue, adults shelter in flowers, and larvae pupate in soil)
Symptoms of Thrips damage on Tomato

3.8.1.F: Tuta Absoluta

3.8.1.F: Tuta Absoluta
Identification:
The moth is grey-brown, same size and posture as diamond back moth (DBM) and has long antenna and lays up to 260 eggs
Newly hatched caterpillars are small (0.5 mm) and yellowish
Mature caterpillars (9 mm: fully grown are yellow-green, have pinkish color on the back and a black band behind the head
Pupae is light brown and size is 6 mm

3.10.3.F: Tuta absoluta

3.8.1.F: Tuta Absoluta
Damages:
The caterpillar burrows (mines) in the middle of the leaf tissue
Unlike other Leafminers, it feeds indiscriminately and from a distance, you see as if leaves are “burning”
Most distinctive symptoms are the blotch-shaped mines in the leaves
It bores on fruits, leaving symptomatic tiny holes
It also burrows on stems causing breakages •	Can lead to 100% crop loss Control:
Early control is important before the pest pressure builds up
Carry out cultural practices like field hygiene, crop rotation
Carry out regular scouting/monitoring of pest population 
Use of pheromone traps to attract male insects for both monitoring/surveillance and pest control e.g.) mating disruption, mass trapping ‘lure & kill’ method, such as Tutrak traps
Use of biological control agents, such as
Chlorantraniliprole (Coragen®)
Indoxacarb (Avaunt 150EC®, Merit 150SC®), Spirotetramat + Flubendiamide (Tihan OD®)
Thiocyclam 50% w/w; Thiocyclam-hydrogenoxalate
(Evisect S®) and - Imidacloprid (Grizly 175/30 SC®)
Flubendiamide (Belt 480SC®)
The above pest control tactics should be combined in an IPM strategy

3.8.2.e: Tomato Mosaic Virus
When the stem of a wilted plant is cut across, the pith has a darkened water – soaked appearance
When stem of wilted plant is squeezed, a greyish slimy ooze is produced
To distinguish this wilt from others when a thin slice is taken from the brown stem tissue and placed inside a glass of water, a milky ooze is produced from  the cut surface
Control:
Practice crop rotation with crops such as cereals
Remove wilted plants, with the soil around roots, from the field and destroy
Solarize planting beds
Spot treatment with Sodium Hypochlorite at 10 %
dilution (Jik) or with lime/ ash

The shape of young leaves is distorted
Internal browning of fruits, especially when fruits are affected at mature green stage
Control:
Use certified disease-free seeds 
Remove crop debris and roots from the field
Do not smoke or touch cigarettes as the virus is transmitted  from tobacco leaves even if it is processed

Symptoms of “Tomato Mosaic Virus” infection on 
3.8.2.f: Blossom-end Rot
General Descriptions:
This is a physiological condition caused by calcium nitrogen imbalance in the soil, especially when moisture level in the soil is low
Symptoms:
A rot at the blossom-end of the fruit
The surface becomes dark brown and sunken
Control:
Maintain adequate soil moisture, especially at fruit development stages 
Soil liming in calcium deficient soils, reduce N and mulch the field
Top-dress with CN, Mavuno Planting and ensure adequate soil moisture
Spray the crop with calcium chloride
Foliar application of EASY-GRO CALCIUM®
3.8.2.g: Fusarium Wilt
General Descriptions:
The fungus is both seed- and soil-borne. 
It causes most damage on light, sandy soils. 
It is most active at temperatures between 25 and 32oC. 
The fungus can survive in the soil indefinitely even when no tomatoes are grown. 
It can also survive in fibrous roots of weeds (e.g. Amaranthus, Digitaria and Malva species). 
Acidic soils (pH 5.0 to 5.6) and excessive nitrogen fertilisation promote disease development.
Symptoms:
The lower leaves of the plant usually turn yellow and die. 
Leaflets on one side may be affected while those on the other side are symptomless. 
Diseased leaves readily break away from the stem. When affected stems just above ground level and petioles are cut diagonally, a reddish-brown discolouration of the water conducting tissues will be observed. 
Control:
Use resistant tomato varieties (e.g. "Fortune Maker", "Rio Grande", "Tengeru 97", "Roma VFN“, “Eden F1”, “Rambo F1”, “Anna F1”).
Use certified disease-free seeds.
Do not locate seedbeds on land where Fusarium wilt is known to have occurred.
Where soil is acidic, raise the pH by applying lime or farmyard manure.
Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilisation and control root-knot nematodes.
Symptoms of Fusarium Wilt
4. Harvest
Harvesting Indices (GHCP&PHHT20: Q17)
Maturity period range between 3 – 4 months after transplanting depending on:
The variety
Environmental conditions
Tomato can be harvested at different stages depending on the market requirement and distance to the market
There are four (4) main harvesting stages:
Mature-Green Stage: where the fruit is green but internal gel is well developed
Breaker/turning Stage: up to 30 % of fruit surface has definite color break from green to yellow
Pink/Light Red Stage: 30 – 90 % fruit surface has pink/red color
Red/Ripe Stage: over 90 % fruit surface has changed to red color
Fruits should be harvested early in the morning when it is cool since the fruit temperature is low
Harvested fruits should be kept in a cool, shaded and ventilated area in order to minimize heat gain
Where necessary, wipe fruits to remove dirt
The yields vary from 12,000 – 40,000kg per acre depending on the variety and crop husbandry
